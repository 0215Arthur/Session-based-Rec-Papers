# Session-based-Rec-Papers
Papers of Session-based Recommendation from top conf/journals.

 This repo mainly collects some papers on the Session-based Recommendation research (Sequential recommendataion) from the top conference (e.g. KDD, CIKM and AAAI) and journals.

 We will update the latest published papers from time to time...
